            <h4>Fonts</h4>
            <p>My fonts will be 'Raleway' and 'Inter'. Raleway will be used for the headings and Inter will be used for
                the main writing.</p>
            <h4>Colors</h4>
            <p>Link: <a href="https://coolors.co/1e1e24-92140c-d5e1e9" target="_blank"> Color Palette</a></p>
            <p>The dark gray will be used for the heading, footer, and the dark text. The light gray will be used to
                help block the elements, the information that goes together.
                The red will be an accent color for join buttons, hovering over the navigation, and other elements to
                break up the page.
