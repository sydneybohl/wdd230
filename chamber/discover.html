                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Cedarburg was founded in the early 1840s by German immigrants who settled around Cedar Creek.
                        In the late 1840s, German immigrants began making Cedarburg into a rural trading center.
                        They built mills, a hotel, and a pharmacy.
                        Now-in-days, this area still remains as Cedarburgâ€™s economic center.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the German community created two Turnhalles in Cedarburg
                        and a neighboring area.
                        Turnen is the German word for gymnastics. In Cedarburg, the German community used these
                        buildings
                        for gymnastics, theater performances, balls, and other big celebrations.</p>

                    <p>After World War II, suburbanization had a major impact on the city of Cedarburg. Cedarburg
                        experienced quick
                        population growth that brought growth of new commercial properties and housing developments.
                        Although the city
                        went under major changes, about 200 historical buildings have been preserved to this day.
                        Cedarburg also began hosting lively festivals and events throughout the year to attract visitors
                        from all over.</p>
